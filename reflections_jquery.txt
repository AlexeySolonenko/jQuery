This files describes reflections on using jQuery.

20170603
Questions that I foresee for this course:
1) When it is worth using a jQuery or another ready package or 
librar. When is it better making methods and functions yourself.

2) What is a good professional pattern of using jQuery.

3) How does jQuery relates to other libaries, Ajax, for instance?



REFLECTIONS LOG
20170603
Started jQuery course today. However, have used it already
quite a number of times.
This course gave me an important refresher of DOM structre.
This course explained such terms as children, siblings, parents,
and others. Though I knew them already, I did not percept them 
properly. James provided an very easily memorizable tree diagram,
with green sheets, which is now in my mind. Also, I instantly 
recalled about CSS selectors. Though I cannot remember anything
clearly now, I am sure that the next time I will work it out, I 
will learn it much better.
